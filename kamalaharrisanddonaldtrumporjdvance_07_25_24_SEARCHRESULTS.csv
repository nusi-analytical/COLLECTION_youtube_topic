At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

The Ohio senator campaigned at his former high school in Middletown before an evening stop in Radford, Virginia, two venues intended to play up his conservative populist appeal across the Rust Belt and small-town America that he said the Biden-Harris administration has forgotten.

“History will remember Joe Biden as not just a quitter, which he is, but as one of the worst presidents in the history of the United States of America,"" Vance said in Virginia. “But my friends, Kamala Harris is a million times worse and everybody knows it. She signed up for every single one of Joe Biden’s failures, and she lied about his mental capacity to serve as president.”

Vance sought to saddle Harris with the administration’s record on inflation and immigration, clarifying the lines of attack that the Trump campaign will use even with the change at the top of the Democratic ticket. Harris still must be formally nominated but has quickly consolidated commitments from top party leaders and is now backed by more than half of the delegates needed to win her party’s nomination vote, according to an Associated Press survey.

“The border crisis is a Kamala Harris crisis,"" Vance said, accusing Biden and Harris together of rolling back immigration policies that Trump enacted in his White House term. He added Harris is “even more extreme than Biden” because, Vance alleged, she has designs on abolishing federal immigration enforcement and domestic police forces. #Politics #Election #News

After a clip of Donald Trump’s running mate from 2021 resurfaced on social media in which he claims that United States is being run by “childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and choices that they made,” the “Friends” star took to her Instagram story to call him out. “I truly can’t believe this is coming from a potential VP of The United States,” the actress wrote on Wednesday, adding, “All I can say is: Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day. I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.” The “Morning Show” star does not have any children and got candid in a December cover story in 2022 with Allure that she tried to get pregnant for many years but struggled with fertility and IVF.

""The political problem that Donald Trump has with his running mate JD Vance is that he doesn't attract a single voter outside the MAGA base. You could argue he's even more consistently MAGA that Trump himself. His rhetoric and boorishness especially turns off the female voters that sent Trump packing in 2020.

When you compare the results by voting demographics between the 2016 and 2020 elections, the various groups were remarkably consistent. However, one group stood out - suburban women. Trump did surprisingly well with suburban women voters in 2016 against Hillary Clinton, keeping things close enough to provide the margin of victory. But in 2020, Trump was crushed by those very voters by a wide margin. ""

Harris did not specifically address in her Washington speech on Monday that she is now the leading Democratic candidate for president and has received endorsement from Biden to be his successor.

Meanwhile in Ohio, Republican vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance accused Kamala Harris, his Senate Democratic colleagues, and the media of lying about President Biden's mental capacity.

""Every single person who saw Joe Biden knew that he wasn't capable of doing the job... that is an insult to voters,” said Vance on Monday, in his hometown of Middletown.

While she may seem underqualified, she is not much more so than the two men she seeks to replace. Criticizing the flaws of leaders generated by US democracy has been a common European practice. It might be more beneficial to focus on their potential strengths instead.
A panel of experts has joined Shreya Upadhyaya to discuss this in detail. Mayor Mableton, Michael Owens, says “The Democratic party right now has a huge advantage..” Also, Journalist, Washington DC Rohit Sharma says “I think it has advantaged Trump right now..” Watch the full discussion to know more and follow Mirror Now for the latest updates.

Former President Donald Trump, who's been seen wearing a bandage on his right ear following an assassination attempt during a weekend rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, announced the pick earlier this week. Introduced by his wife, Usha Vance, the 39-year-old detailed his own life story and said, ""Tonight is a night of hope. A celebration of what America once was, and with God’s grace, what it will soon be again."" His speech comes on the same day that President Biden's campaign said Vice President Harris accepted a date of August 12th for a debate with Vance on CBS. The Trump campaign would not commit.

As US president Joe Biden recuperates from Covid-19, vice-president Kamala Harris has become the standard bearer of their reelection effort, visiting the battleground states of Michigan and North Carolina this past week before headlining a well-attended fundraiser in Massachusetts on Saturday.

Harris has assumed the starring role at a time when a growing number of Democratic elected officials are pushing for her to become the party’s nominee. Both voters and donors say they have grown dissatisfied with the president, and the campaign’s fundraising efforts have sputtered. (Video: Reuters)",4419,94,2.1271%

Back in 2021, J.D. Vance attacked politicians on the left for not having children, arguing that they should have less of a say in politics because they don’t have a ‘stake’ in the future of the country. 

Vance said that these ‘childless cat ladies’ are ‘miserable,’ when in reality, childless, single women are among the happiest demographics in the country.

Phó tướng JD Vance: Bà Harris tệ hơn Tổng thống Biden triệu lần
JD Vance, ứng viên phó tổng thống tranh cử cùng ông Trump, cho rằng bà Harris ""tệ hơn Tổng thống Biden triệu lần"" và cả hai đều không đủ khả năng lãnh đạo đất nước.

""Giờ đây, lịch sử sẽ ghi nhớ Tổng thống Joe Biden không chỉ là người bỏ cuộc, mà còn là một trong những Tổng thống tệ nhất của nước Mỹ. Nhưng các bạn của tôi à, Phó tổng thống Kamala Harris còn tệ hơn ông ấy cả triệu lần và ai cũng biết điều này"", ứng viên phó tổng thống của đảng Cộng hòa JD Vance nói trong cuộc vận động tranh cử ở thành phố Radford, bang Virginia ngày 22/7.

Ông Vance cáo buộc bà Harris ủng hộ ""những thất bại"" của Tổng thống Biden cũng như nói dối rằng ""ông Biden đủ năng lực trí tuệ để làm tổng thống"". Theo Vance, dấu ấn của bà Harris cũng giống như ông Biden và cả hai đều không phù hợp đảm đương vai trò lãnh đạo.

""Liệu ai đó có thể thừa nhận nếu Biden không đủ tiêu chuẩn để tranh cử tổng thống, thì ông ấy cũng không đủ tiêu chuẩn để làm tổng thống"", ông nói. ""Nếu Kamala Harris mù quáng hoặc tệ hại đến mức không thừa nhận với người dân Mỹ rằng ông Biden không bao giờ nên ngồi ở vị trí lãnh đạo, thì bà ấy cũng không đủ tư cách để trở thành lãnh đạo"".

In a clip from 2021, Vance told former #foxnews host Tucker #carlson that the country was run by “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives. Look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC, the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,” Vance continued. “How does it make any sense we’ve turned our country over to people who don’t really have a direct stake in it?”

On her Instagram Story Wednesday, actress Jennifer Aniston reposted the clip with the below comments.

“I truly can’t believe this is coming from a potential VP of The United States,” Aniston wrote. “All I can say is… Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day.”.

Vance says that the ""childless left"" idea grew out of a conversation with a friend who noted that DC was near the top of lists of cities where adults had the fewest children.
""I was like — oh, that's really odd, right?"" Vance recalled. ""The city that's governing for the rest of the country is also the place that, in some ways, is the least like the rest of the country, where most people do want to have children, and most people do start families.""
The childless factor, said Vance, might explain to him why so many policymakers favored school mask mandates during the pandemic. ""When you have children, and you've interacted with children regularly, I think you realize how many of the left policies are really harmful to kids,"" he said.",11275,485,4.3015%

GRAND RAPIDS, Michigan — Republican vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance dinged Vice President Kamala Harris during his campaign trail debut in Grand Rapids.

“The vice president, Kamala Harris, she doesn’t like me,” Vance told the crowd Saturday. “Kamala Harris said something to the effect of that I have no loyalty to this country.

Vance and Democrat Rep. Tim Ryan defend their ties with their party's leadership.

RELATED: Ohio Senate candidates Tim Ryan, J.D. Vance debate abortion, police https://bit.ly/3S4sSoQ

Republican J.D. Vance and Democratic U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan faced off in the hour-long debate hosted by WFMJ in Youngstown. The event was more heated and personal than last week's debate in Cleveland, in part because of a format that allowed the candidates to spar back and forth with no time limits. Vance and Ryan are vying for the Senate seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Rob Portman in the Nov. 8 election.

Both candidates kicked off the debate assuring voters that they're their own man. Vance dismissed Trump's comment that the Senate candidate is ""kissing my a--"" as a joke and accused Ryan of focusing his entire campaign on the quip. Ryan said Ohioans want an ""a-- kicker, not an a-- kisser"" at last week's debate, and his campaign created an internet meme of Trump-themed Chapstick.

Ryan, meanwhile, presented himself as independent of Democratic leadership even though he's voted with President Joe Biden's agenda 100% of the time, according to FiveThirtyEight. When Vance pointed this out, Ryan noted that he challenged Speaker Nancy Pelosi for the position of top Democrat in 2016.

Both were officially nominated to rapturous applause last night, but the process for confirming Joe Biden as his Democrat opponent is quietly also about to begin.

Vance deviendra le vice-président des États-Unis. Ce dernier a accepté la nomination de son parti et a prononcé un discours en faveur des classes populaires américaines.

Le sénateur J.D. Vance a par ailleurs participé mercredi après-midi (17 juillet 2024) à une collecte de fonds pour sa campagne, ce qui constitue sa première apparition publique officielle à l'extérieur de la convention républicaine depuis qu'il a été désigné colistier de Donald Trump, lundi (15 juillet 2024).

Celui qui s'est notamment fait connaître pour son livre « Hillbilly Elegy », qui porte sur la désillusion de la classe ouvrière blanche dans sa ville d'enfance de Middletown en Ohio, a fait part de quelques statistiques pour dénoncer l'augmentation du coût de la vie dans cet État sous l’administration de Joe Biden.

Dans son reportage, notre correspondante Azeb Wolde-Giorghis nous présente ce politicien de 39 ans.

Vance, author of “Hillbilly Elegy,” on his wonderful Fox News programme. What a terrific pair: One is heir to a Chicken Dynasty and the other grew up dirt poor and surrounded by drug addiction, mental illness, and abuse. You’d think that they’d come to different conclusions about people, but they don’t! J.D. Vance is also total garbage and completely blames everyone he grew up alongside for their personal failings and credits mostly himself with escaping such a fate and eventually going to Yale Law School. They are trash and he is just better. 
With that said, J.D. Vance is on Tucker Carlson’s show to join him in calling Kamala Harris disingenuous and incompetent, but also to discuss the increasing violence, general lack of safety, and dirtiness of U.S. cities. He also throws in that while it’s not safe to raise a family in any of these cities, it’s also not affordable.

Vance will not participate in any debates, at least for now. The campaign claims that since they don't know who the Democrats are going to nominate, they aren't going to take any chances of letting Vance agree to debate. What are they so afraid of? Does this mean that there are candidates that actually scare Vance? Ring of Fire's Farron Cousins explains what's happening.

So right now, talk is swirling all over the internet, all over the media that President Biden, uh, is likely to drop out of the race. He may drop out this weekend, he may drop out early next week. He may not drop out at all. We all know nobody knows what's happening, and nobody is happier about that than the Trump campaign, because the Trump campaign is actually using this. Will he or won't he about President Biden as an excuse to prevent JD Vance from agreeing to any vice presidential debates. Now, vice President Kamala Harris has already agreed to several different dates where we could have a vice presidential debate. She said, we can do it July 23rd. We can do it August 12th, August 13th. I'm ready. Let's go. Harris says, and the Trump campaign issued a statement saying, quote, we don't know who the Democrat nominee for vice president is going to be. 

So we, we can't lock in a date before their convention to do so, would be unfair to Gavin Newsom, JB Pritzker, Gretchen Whitmer, or whoever Kamala Harris picks as her running mate. Oh, we wanna be fair, right? We, we don't wanna put a Gavin Newsom or a Pritzker or Whitmer in a position. You know, we, we don't wanna make decisions for those people because that's just so incredibly rude. Well, guess what? At least as of this recording, the Vice presidential candidate is Kamala Harris. So why don't you just go ahead and plan on debating her if that changes over the weekend. Change the thing. Like, that's all you gotta do. You just say, okay, well, we'll do this instead. It's not that difficult. You could easily do that. What they are doing is protecting JD Vance, because apparently they're a little bit worried that he's gonna get on, on a debate stage with a year and a half of political experience and make a complete and total of himself, which by the way, is a valid concern. 

Yes, JD Vance is highly educated, okay? I am not denying that he is an intelligent person. I, I do think he is. He is one of the few Republicans that I do think has a, a pretty solid grasp, you know, on intellect. He is also an opportunist. He's also a bit of a conman, in my opinion, just like Donald Trump, you know, going whichever way the wind blows, whichever suits him politically, which is why he had that about face and now loves Trump as opposed to hating him a few years ago. But the campaign must see something that the public is not aware of, something that they wanna hide, something that they wanna protect JD Vance from exposing about him himself. If he gets up there on a debate stage, it doesn't matter who the nominee is gonna be, it doesn't matter at all. You could go ahead and agree to a debate. You could say, okay, 

Well, if Biden's not the nominee, how about we just go ahead and set a date for September? It'll be after the Democratic Convention. There'll be no question about it then. So September 1st, second, third, fourth, fifth, you can pick any date in September. You could pick a date in October, but y'all won't do it, and you're trying to blame it on the Democrats because clearly you're trying to protect JD Vance from himself, and I can't wait to find out why.",64805,4747,7.325%

And it's because of Vance's Indian Origin wife Usha Chilukuri. The 38-year-old Yale graduate is the daughter of Indian immigrants. As she joins the Trump campaign, Asian Americans hope the increase in representation will correspond with a push to connect with a voting bloc that has long been overlooked. Asian Americans are the fastest-growing racial or ethnic group of eligible voters in the United States. The Trump campaign is hoping that Usha Vance could appeal to minority voters. The 2024 presidential campaign has seen three politicians of South Asian descent vying for the White House: Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy both competed during the Republican primaries, while Vice President Kamala Harris is running for a second term with President Joe Biden.

Gov. Andy Beshear (D-KY) continued his assault on Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH), saying he has “no conviction,” while former President Donald Trump “has 34.”

Beshear is widely seen as a top contender as running mate for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris. The interest has put him in the national spotlight, where he has begun campaigning against Vance, the running mate of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, with Beshear speaking as someone from the same geographical region.

“I think that Kamala Harris, like a lot of folks who come from our elite class, they have this stereotype of small town America that it’s all backwards and people don’t have the basic things that they need. But if you talk to people, you talk to Ohioans, or if you just read a poll you find out that rural Americans are actually strongly in favor of voter ID.

“So I think the Kamala Harris’s of the world should leave their condescension to their staffers and actually listen to what their constituents are saying. Because those people are saying we actually want voter ID. We want safe and secure elections. Let us figure out how to accomplish that.”

Conservative Outsider. Marine. Businessman. Author.

JD grew up in Middletown, Ohio, a once flourishing American manufacturing town where Ohioans could actually live a middle-class life. But over time, he witnessed jobs and economic opportunities slowly disappear from the community, leaving family, friends, and neighbors with nothing.

Turbulence was common at home and at school. JD’s father left home when he was a young boy. His mother struggled with drug addiction his entire life. His grandmother, called Mamaw, was his saving grace. Her tough love and discipline kept him on the straight and narrow. That, or maybe the fact that she owned 19 handguns. She taught him the importance of being grounded in faith and family and the prospect that a better life lay ahead.

JD went on to serve our nation in the Iraq War as a proud Marine, graduated from The Ohio State University, received his law degree from Yale Law School, and became a successful investor in Silicon Valley. He wrote a bestselling book, Hillbilly Elegy, which was turned into a movie on Netflix.

After the success of his book, JD became a well-known commentator. On conservative and liberal networks, JD fiercely defended working-class Americans and the conservative way of life that values grit, determination, and freedom. JD is now a fixture on Fox News Channel, Newsmax, and other outlets.

JD moved back to Ohio in 2017. He has seen firsthand livelihoods devastated by job loss, addiction, economic turmoil and so much more. He started a business in Cincinnati and has focused on growing companies that create well-paying jobs. His business experience taught him firsthand that so many American companies struggle with unfair competition from China and from their own government, which often rewards multinational technology firms over Ohio small businesses.

Ohio needs a true conservative in the U.S. Senate. It needs someone who understands how our economic and government leaders conspire to make life harder for normal Americans. It needs someone who knows what it’s like to live in a left-behind community. It needs someone who is not a career politician, recycling cheap establishment talking points instead of focusing on our real problems.

A conservative outsider. That outsider is JD Vance.

Vance made the comments during a Fox News interview, claiming that because Harris isn't a mother, she doesn't have a “direct stake in the country's future.""

Kamala is part of a blended family and is a stepmother to her husband's two children from a previous marriage. Her campaign responded to Vance's clip saying, “Every single American has a stake in this country's future.”

Vance has been named the Republican nominee for Vice President of the United States, chosen by former President Donald Trump as his running mate in the 2024 presidential election. It marks the first time in 1944 that an Ohio native has been on a presidential ticket, and also leads to speculation regarding the future of his Senate seat.

Of course, if the Trump-Vance ticket loses to the Democratic duo of current President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris in November, Vance will almost certainly return to Congress, where he won't be up for reelection until 2028. But if Trump wins a second nonconsecutive term and Vance ascends to within a heartbeat of the nation's highest office, someone will have to replace him in the Senate, and there are several laws reflecting how that process must take place.

Here's a look at the rules for naming a successor: https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/local/ohio/what-will-happen-if-ohio-us-sen-jd-vance-becomes-vice-president-rules-for-naming-successor/95-20d2ad65-28b7-4c26-9d41-005b0e50ae5a --

JD Vance, Trump's likely VP pick. 

Concerns about President Biden's viability have put Harris in the spotlight, with some Democrats considering her as a potential presidential candidate. Harris views Vance as a formidable debate opponent, particularly on issues like reproductive rights and Trump's threat to democracy.

Biden's recent debate performance has intensified discussions about his ability to lead, with some Democrats urging him to step down. A poll shows 6 in 10 Democrats believe Harris would make a good president, while 65% think Biden should drop out. On the campaign trail, Harris focuses on Trump, using Vance as an example of Trump's extreme agenda, particularly on abortion. Despite insider discussions, Harris publicly supports Biden and emphasizes party unity. Her campaign message aims to keep Trump and his allies on the defensive, making the 2024 race one to watch closely. Stay tuned for more updates!",495,2,0.404%

Partai Demokrat yang mengusung pasangan calon presiden (capres) dan calon wakil presiden (cawapres) Joe Biden dan Kamala Harris melancarkan serangan baru terhadap Partai Republik setelah Donald Trump menunjuk JD Vance sebagai calon wakil presiden, Senin (15/7/2024).

Joe Biden akan melawan Donald Trump dalam pemilihan presiden (Pilpres) AS yang akan dilaksanakan pada 5 November 2024.

Partai Demokrat berusaha menggambarkan JD Vance, yang merupakan Senator Ohio, sebagai seorang ekstremis pembela hak aborsi dan dulu menentang Donald Trump, namun kini menjadi cawapresnya.

JD Vance of Ohio as purveyors of “extreme” and “divisive” plans who would undermine the middle class.

Her trip to Fayetteville, N.C., was her first campaign appearance since Vance formally accepted a spot on the Republican ticket at his party’s convention a day earlier, and her speech was in some ways an initial effort to define her new opponent, who has emphasized his working-class roots.

“It’s a compelling story — and it was not the full story,” she said of his speech on Wednesday night, adding that Americans were “not buying” claims from Trump that “he and his running mate are going to prioritize the middle class” and unify the country.

""We just got a great chance to govern, and we need to use it,"" Vance told his supporters Tuesday night after Ryan ""graciously"" called him to concede.

Vance: A Rubber Stamp for Trump's Extreme Agenda

In a recent video, Vice President Kamala Harris has expressed strong criticism of former President Donald Trump's choice for vice president, Senator J.D. Vance. Harris accused Vance of being a ""rubber stamp"" for Trump's ""extreme"" agenda and warned that if elected, Vance would help implement the controversial Project 2025 plan for a second Trump term. This plan has been described as extreme and includes targeting critical programs like Head Start and Medicare.

Harris's comments come after Trump announced Vance as his running mate, a decision that has sparked debate and controversy. The Vice President emphasized the importance of electing leaders who prioritize the well-being of the country and its citizens over loyalty to a single individual. She called on voters to reject Trump's agenda and the potential implementation of Project 2025, which she believes would have detrimental effects on the nation.

The video was released as part of the ongoing political discourse surrounding the upcoming presidential election and the role of the vice presidency. Harris's remarks highlight the stark differences in vision and approach between the Biden-Harris administration and a potential second Trump term.

Here is what Tulsi Gabbard responded to Kamala Harris. 

JD Vance enlisted in the Marine Corps after 9/11 and deployed to Iraq in 2005, the same year I was there during the height of the war. 

He put his life on the line in service to our country. 
Was Kamala Harris ready to sacrifice her life for our country? 
Of course not. Once again, Kamala exposes her hypocrisy.

Zionist, genocide Joe Biden is giving israel bombs. Zionist israel uses those bombs to kill LGBTQ+ Palestinians and heterosexual Palestinians.

After a TERRIBLE debate performance on June 27, 2024, many democrats want to replace zionist Joe Biden with zionist Gavin Newsom or zionist Kamala Harris.

The imperialist, zionist, corrupt Democratic Party and the imperialist, zionist, corrupt Republican Party have been in the White House for more than 160 years. Enough Is Enough! There are other political parties in the USA.

Before New York City, there was Lenapehoking, the ancestral land of the Lenape people. Forcibly displaced by White European invaders, their land was stolen to create settler states. We live on stolen land. LAND BACK NOW!

Lenapehoking translated as 'homelands of the Lenape'. The territory of the Lenape people before White Europeans invaders arrived was known to them as Lenapehoking, and it covered roughly the area between New York City and Philadelphia, including all of New Jersey, eastern Pennsylvania and part of the state of Delaware.

The Lenape, New York City and Manhattan’s original inhabitants, called the island Manahatta, which means “hilly island.” White European invaders stole Manahatta and all of New York City from the Lenape people.

Kamala Harris Congratulates JD Vance, Anticipates Potential VP Debate Showdown
https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-congratulates-jd-vance-hopes-that-two-can-meet-vp-debate
Summary:
Vice President Kamala Harris congratulates Senator JD Vance, R-Ohio, on his selection as former President Trump's running mate for the 2024 election. Harris expressed interest in meeting Vance in a proposed vice-presidential debate by CBS News. Known for his memoir ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" Vance's nomination marks a significant development, potentially posing a strong challenge to Harris, who faces critiques for her communication style. The announcement came during the Republican National Convention, adding intrigue to the upcoming debates that could shape the election narrative.

Description:
In a surprising political move, Vice President Kamala Harris reached out to Senator JD Vance, R-Ohio, to congratulate him on being selected as former President Trump's running mate for the upcoming 2024 election. Harris left a message expressing her hope to meet Vance in a vice-presidential debate, which CBS News has proposed. This marks a significant moment in the race, as JD Vance, known for his memoir ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" could pose a substantial challenge to Harris in a debate setting.

Vance's nomination was announced by Trump in a Truth Social post during the opening of the Republican National Convention. The selection has already stirred political dynamics, especially concerning the ongoing debates between President Biden and former President Trump. While no vice-presidential debate has been confirmed, the prospect of Harris facing off against Vance is seen as a potentially challenging scenario for the current Vice President.

Ashley Etienne, Harris' former communications director, noted that Vance is an incredible debater with a quality that appeals to undecided voters, making him a formidable opponent. She highlighted Vance's intelligence and quick wit as strengths that could overshadow Harris, who has occasionally been criticized for her ""word salads"" or rambling monologues. These characteristics have often become viral moments on social media, sometimes leading to comedic portrayals, such as on Saturday Night Live.

The possibility of a debate between Harris and Vance brings into focus the critical role of effective communication in political contests. As both parties gear up for the debates, the stakes are high, and the performances in these debates could significantly influence voter perceptions.

The Republican National Convention, where Trump officially announced Vance as his running mate, is taking place in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, from July 15-18, 2024. This event gathers delegates, politicians, and party faithful to solidify their strategies and present their candidates to the nation. Vance's entry into the race adds a new layer of excitement and uncertainty, especially with the upcoming vice-presidential debate still under negotiation.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, all eyes will be on how Harris and Vance prepare for a potential debate. The outcome could shape the narrative of the 2024 election and determine the strategies each campaign will adopt moving forward. Harris' congratulatory gesture indicates a respectful acknowledgment of Vance's entry into the race, setting the stage for a potentially historic vice-presidential contest.

Sự kiện diễn ra khi Tổng thống Joe Biden đang cách ly vì COVID-19. Trong bài phát biểu, Harris chỉ trích cựu Tổng thống Donald Trump và Thượng nghị sĩ JD Vance, gọi dự án năm 2025 của họ là ""cực đoan và gây chia rẽ"", cho rằng các chính sách của họ sẽ làm sâu sắc thêm sự phân hóa xã hội.

Cuộc vận động diễn ra trong bối cảnh Biden đối mặt với áp lực từ đảng Dân chủ về việc kết thúc chiến dịch tranh cử, trong khi Trump chuẩn bị nhận đề cử của đảng Cộng hòa vào ngày 18 tháng 7. Harris đã yêu cầu JD Vance tham gia cuộc tranh luận do CBS tổ chức vào ngày 13 tháng 8. Mặc dù đã có cuộc nói chuyện giữa hai bên, nhưng các điều khoản của cuộc tranh luận vẫn chưa được thống nhất.

Việc Harris chỉ trích Trump và Vance phản ánh mối lo ngại về các chính sách cực đoan và nhấn mạnh sự cần thiết phải duy trì đoàn kết trong thời điểm khó khăn. Sự tham gia tích cực của Harris trong vận động tranh cử cho thấy vai trò quan trọng của bà trong chiến dịch tái tranh cử của Biden. Harris's chuyến đi và chỉ trích đối thủ nhấn mạnh cam kết bảo vệ các giá trị của chính quyền Biden, đồng thời phản ánh sự cần thiết phải duy trì sự ổn định và tránh xa các chính sách chia rẽ trong cuộc đua tổng thống năm tới. Kamala Harris chỉ trích JD Vance và Trump tại sự kiện vận động ở Bắc Carolina .

Trump’s choice of J.D. Vance, aimed at securing the base, is now seen as a mistake, with allies questioning the decision amidst the changing political landscape. Republicans are pushing conspiracy theories about Biden’s health and a supposed coup within the Democratic Party. Accusations also emerge against Elon Musk for limiting Harris’s campaign account on X, possibly to aid Trump. Trump now seeks to host the next debate on Fox News, adjusting to the new dynamics of the race.

“The look at middle America - people who are actually pretty happy with their lives and the choices that they’ve made - and they hate normal Americans for choosing family over these ridiculous DC and New York status games. I think because of that, they just get so angry when someone calls it what it is.

“It’s acceptable if they ignore that it ever happens, but if someone calls out that ‘Look, if you’re a miserable cat-lady, you should not force your misery on the rest of the country’, they just get really upset about it. And I think it’s a good thing that they get upset about it. It suggests that they know that we’re hitting a nerve. Not just in this campaign, but with this message that we should invest in American families in this country. If nothing else, we should be about healthy, stable families.”

Conservative Outsider. Marine. Businessman. Author.

JD grew up in Middletown, Ohio, a once flourishing American manufacturing town where Ohioans could actually live a middle-class life. But over time, he witnessed jobs and economic opportunities slowly disappear from the community, leaving family, friends, and neighbors with nothing.

Turbulence was common at home and at school. JD’s father left home when he was a young boy. His mother struggled with drug addiction his entire life. His grandmother, called Mamaw, was his saving grace. Her tough love and discipline kept him on the straight and narrow. That, or maybe the fact that she owned 19 handguns. She taught him the importance of being grounded in faith and family and the prospect that a better life lay ahead.

JD went on to serve our nation in the Iraq War as a proud Marine, graduated from The Ohio State University, received his law degree from Yale Law School, and became a successful investor in Silicon Valley. He wrote a bestselling book, Hillbilly Elegy, which was turned into a movie on Netflix.

After the success of his book, JD became a well-known commentator. On conservative and liberal networks, JD fiercely defended working-class Americans and the conservative way of life that values grit, determination, and freedom. JD is now a fixture on Fox News Channel, Newsmax, and other outlets.

JD moved back to Ohio in 2017. He has seen firsthand livelihoods devastated by job loss, addiction, economic turmoil and so much more. He started a business in Cincinnati and has focused on growing companies that create well-paying jobs. His business experience taught him firsthand that so many American companies struggle with unfair competition from China and from their own government, which often rewards multinational technology firms over Ohio small businesses.

Ohio needs a true conservative in the U.S. Senate. It needs someone who understands how our economic and government leaders conspire to make life harder for normal Americans. It needs someone who knows what it’s like to live in a left-behind community. It needs someone who is not a career politician, recycling cheap establishment talking points instead of focusing on our real problems.

A conservative outsider. That outsider is JD Vance.

Vance wants to let all children in America vote — but only if their parents get control of those votes. In a 2021 speech, Vance laid out his belief that people with kids should have “more power” when they go to the polls than people without kids.

Vance, who is Donald Trump’s choice for vice president, has also repeatedly criticized Kamala Harris (who has step-children) and other Democrats as “childless cat ladies.”

Vance: Marjorie Greene: Tim Scott #kamala #trump #greene,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bvZ-AKiQ9OE/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bvZ-AKiQ9OE/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bvZ-AKiQ9OE/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,MoeAI24,none,2024-07-24T21:09:16Z,"The Failed DEI Hires of God: MAGA, Trump, and the Good Ole Boys Network
In the realm of political satire, few subjects are as ripe for parody as the MAGA movement and its leader, Donald Trump. Their latest farce? The misuse of ""DEI"" (diversity, equity, and inclusion) as a slur, oblivious to the nepotism and favoritism that have propelled many within their own ranks.

#### The DEI Conundrum

""DEI"" is meant to represent principles that promote fairness and representation. Yet, the MAGA crowd, in their infinite wisdom, have co-opted it as a pejorative. They slap the label on Vice President Kamala Harris, implying her achievements are not due to her competence but to an imagined affirmative action. This accusation is rich with irony, considering many of these critics owe their positions to old-school nepotism and the favors of generational wealth.

#### The Failed DEI Hires of God

In this twisted narrative, we find the so-called ""failed DEI hires of God"" – characters like Trump, Marjorie Taylor Greene (affectionately known as ""Butch"" for her bleach-blonde bravado), J.D. Vance, and a parade of other MAGA rats. These figures champion meritocracy while conveniently forgetting their own gilded paths paved by connections and inherited privilege.

Congressman Maxwell Frost brilliantly encapsulated this irony on national television. 

""This is a right-wing campaign that’s going to be racist and misogynist against the vice president. But we‘re going to stand on the issues and what really matters is the fact that she is qualified,"" Frost told anchor Jim Acosta on ""CNN Newsroom.""

""They want to call her a DEI president – a DEI candidate. She has more experience than Trump and J.D. Vance combined times a million, right? She worked at the state level. She was the attorney general,"" he added.

#### The Hypocrisy of Unity

The Republicans love to preach unity, but they can’t even spell it, let alone grasp its meaning. They claim to unite the country, but their actions speak louder than their hollow words. Unity under MAGA? That’s as believable as Trump’s spray tan being natural.

As the MAGA rhetoric continues to unravel, we see their true colors – a party clinging to outdated tropes and manufactured outrage. The more they scream about DEI, the more they reveal their own insecurities and failures.

#### Conclusion

In this satirical universe, the MAGA movement’s obsession with DEI is nothing more than a smokescreen for their inadequacies. They can label Kamala Harris all they want, but the truth is clear: she’s more qualified than Trump and J.D. Vance combined, and no amount of MAGA spin can change that. So, as they fumble through their hypocritical chants of unity, the rest of us can sit back and enjoy the show, knowing that the joke is, and always will be, on them.",834,15,1.7985%

Vance was referring to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Vice President Kamala Harris, adding that voters have “turned our country over to people who don’t really have a direct stake in it.”

Goldberg reacted to the resurfaced interview by addressing Vance directly — noting, “You never had a baby! So you know nothing about this!”

“Sir, there are people who have chosen not to have children for whatever reason. There are people who want to have children who cannot,” Goldberg responded.

She added, “How dare you! You never had a baby. Your wife had a baby, but you never had a baby. So you know nothing about this. And how dare you! And women, you heard how he thinks of you. Yeah. This is not good for you, JD!”

Song: Full Spectrum Dominance

Text:

Liegst auf dem Heldenfriedhof
Unter Flagge und nem Kranz
Dann wurdest du verheizt für
Full Spectrum Dominance

Belügen sie dich täglich
Gehen dir an die Substanz
Bist auch du ein Opfer der
Full Spectrum Dominance

In relevanten Bereichen
Sind sie der Hegemon
Bei IT, Propaganda, Währung die
Dominante Nation
Haben Hoheit über die Meere
Das All und den Zahlungsverkehr
Regime Changes und immer
Das stärkste Militär

Belügen sie dich täglich
Gehen dir an die Substanz
Bist auch du ein Opfer der
Full Spectrum Dominance
Stürzen die Regierung
Zum Wohle der Bilanz
Dann ist das eine Folge der
Full Spectrum Dominance

Exzeptionalismus 
Der USA
Verheizt arme Menschen 
Im Proxy-War
Völkerrecht gilt nur 
Wenn es ihnen nützt
Vor Gerichtsbarkeit 
Die Bombe schützt

Belügen sie dich täglich
Gehen dir an die Substanz
Bist auch du ein Opfer der
Full Spectrum Dominance
Bist arm und ohne Einfluss
Hast keine Relevanz
Dann hat das seinen Ursprung in
Full Spectrum Dominance

Die Stadt auf dem Hügel
Gottes Nation
Fürs Foltergefängnis 
Die Absolution
Sagen wir es deutlich
Nicht drumherum
Sind in allen Bereichen
Das Imperium

Belügen sie dich täglich
Gehen dir an die Substanz
Bist auch du ein Opfer der
Full Spectrum Dominance

Lebst unter einer Brücke
Hat dein Lifestyle keinen Glanz
Dann leidest du vermutlich unter
Full Spectrum Dominance

Belügen sie dich täglich
Gehen dir an die Substanz
Bist auch du ein Opfer der
Full Spectrum Dominance

Liegst auf dem Heldenfriedhof
Unter Flagge und nem Kranz
Dann wurdest du verheizt für
Full Spectrum Dominance

A week after former President Donald Trump was nearly assassinated at a Pennsylvania rally, a speaker at an Ohio rally for his running mate on Monday called for ""civil war"" if Trump doesn't win back the White House.

""I'm afraid that if we lose this, it's going to take a civil war to save the country,"" Cincinnati Sen. George Lang said just before Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance took the stage at his first solo rally in Middletown, his hometown.

Trump campaign officials did not respond to HuffPost's questions about Lang's remarks, but Lang apologized to them about a half hour later in a social media post.

“I regret the divisive comments I made in the excitement of the moment on stage. Especially in light of the assassination attempt on President Trump last week, we should all be mindful of what is said at political events, including myself,” he wrote.

The campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris, now the presumptive Democratic nominee after Joe Biden dropped out of this year’s presidential race, was quick to note that calls for violence are not new at Trump events.

“Donald Trump and JD Vance are waging a public campaign to sow hatred and promise revenge against their political opponents,” Harris campaign spokesman Ammar Moussa said in a statement. “It is a feature, not a bug, of their campaign and their message to the American people. That is why a Republican official is empowered to predict a civil war while introducing these candidates.” #news #breakingnews #trump",849,10,1.1778%

The future first husband is on the campaign trail with Harris 

Trump teams, considering changing JD Vance as candidate because of all the comments he made about Trump and all the derogatory comments he made about women and his record venture capital doesn’t build anything just destroys

In this world, people of color and brown people or people that haven’t been as fair skin have always been given the shaft in Mexico it’s always the lighter tall, fair skin people that migrated there that run that country even though the vast majority of Mexicans are short or brown or indigenous looking people 

Every fair skinned country in the world can come to the United States with immunity anytime they wish and stay as long as they want yet the people from  Haiti they turn their ships around and  let them get eaten by sharks. Brazil run by predominantly, fair skinned Jewish and fair skin Portuguese, mostly whiter skin  People and Brazil 98% of the population is either dark skin mulatto or brown. Those people get shafted. In the United States of America African-Americans have finally taken their stake with the first black president with people in Congress with the first Supreme Court Justice that was African-American woman appointed, We will skip Clarence uncle Tom Thomas, we began to move forward up the chain and the ladder in this country , and Republicans still refused to see that this country is changing demographically and mixing into the great American melting pot It always was supposed to be. Republicans refuse to accept change. They refuse to accept global warming. They refuse to accept equal pay equal rights. They refused to accept losses elections. 
And Republicans refuse to accept that this country is changing for the better. Republicans want to take us completely backwards to a time when it was one race against another. A time when racism was rampant and people didn’t have equal rights. America has steadily moved forward and Republicans and conservatives around the world are trying to pull up power and take us backwards. It’s not working.

Trump complaining now he wants the debate to take place on Fox News fake news channel where he has all the cards because Fox News just drums up a bunch of lies. Fox News has been fine. $2 billion for promoting lies Trump afraid to debate Kamala Harris is looking for any excuse so he can to get out of it. Trump wants to claim ABC is not worthy enough. He’s not worthy enough.

America’s choices are a real estate fraudster Con artist  felon and adventure capitalist, JD Vance or a senator an attorney general vice president it’s not rocket science that the choice of Kamala Harris is the most qualified and most dignified presidential candidate

Vice president Harris will pick Roy Cooper or Scott Kelly. I put my money she picks Roy Cooper. She gets that southern vote which will transform to rural America.

And can somebody please tell me why Joe Manchin has any airtime or authority to speak on anything?
