"I've come to the unfortunate conclusion that Colbert is extremely biased, bordering on hypocrisy. He has plenty of opportunity to call out genocide in Palestine, Biden's and Democrats' role in the enabling of the mass murder but alas he only sees Trump. 

His whole act is about demonizing others while adopting a holier than thou attitude.

"It's been 4 years, no one has given a replacement for """"Defund the Police"""" at all. If it was so easy, and DTP was so miserable surely, folks would have come up with a better alternative by now, right?

Meanwhile, in political circles, it seems to have lent itself to actual attempts at policy changes when allowed to be given the nuance it deserves. It's only talking heads, bad faith actors and people who don't want to engage with the actual meaning who keep talking about it as """"bad branding."""" GIRL. It was an activist slogan.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

"Actually look up the origin of Vance's """"Childless Cat Ladies"""" remark.  He was actually very, very respectful to those who can't have children.  His remarks had to do with a specific type of woman who has taken over the Democrat Party, and I think that part is accurate.  The screeching, miserable single woman that wants to drag everyone else down with her.  That is without question the base of the Democrat Party.  Well adjusted Men and Women always vote Republican.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpnam2VJhGs&lc=UgxbFJyI7bQekGYC1pN4AaABAg,@ThePopeII,The View,Rpnam2VJhGs,Vance Criticized Harris For Being &#39;Childless&#39; In 2021 | The View,"After a video resurfaced of J.D.

Just like everyone JD can have his own opinion as well. There is no need to be flamed up ... and it is true there are many who keep chasing a career but at some point in life they realize they should have made a family but guess it is too late now. I have seen many in my life in this position and they are miserable and depressed. So take this as an advice for better. Nothing against people who dont want to and are happy without kids. Everyone relax and access their own situation plz. If JD was running as Joe Biden mate I am sure this wouldn't be in the news this much.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpnam2VJhGs&lc=Ugz0nB_zKcpTr3H41QZ4AaABAg,@writehaseeb,The View,Rpnam2VJhGs,Vance Criticized Harris For Being &#39;Childless&#39; In 2021 | The View,"After a video resurfaced of J.D.

"Being a woman who has two children, and can speak for MYSELF…let me clarify - the most miserable women I know - are NOT independent, childless ‘career women’…but women who gave up their careers and married misogynist men…just like JD Vance. Women who made the regrettable mistake of allowing a ‘woman belittling’ MISOGYNIST…be the sperm donor to her children. Because women in those situations…are ALL desperately wanting divorces. But the misogynistic (control freak) man keeps her barefoot and pregnant, and makes sure her access to the ‘shared matrimonial income’…is as limited as if she were one of the small children, keeping her TRAPPED in the miserable world he controls and belittles her into submission…on a daily basis.

"As far as I know, nobody blames divorced politicians for giving a hard time to their kids either because people have an understanding that unfortunate things like divorce may happen. Why am I bringing this up? Many Republicans like MTG, Trump, Boebert, etc. have divorced with multiple children. Evidently, that is not what God intended to happen either. Harris has stepchildren. It is insulting to ignore the fact she probably participated in and contributed to raising those children so stepparents are not parents? Many Republicans are divorced. How is that acceptable by these standards? This individual wants to be the vice president with this very rigid mentality of no lifestyle is acceptable unless he approves of it? That means he will only represent some people but not all people. Why is he so bitter and radical? Btw, it is easy for a guy to have many children but a woman hardly ever achieves a high-level promotion if she has children because she is a caretaker in the first place for years when men have the opportunity to work without interruptions, which ultimately gets held against her at work. I don't know why Harris did not have children. That is only her business but if she had had children, no matter how hard she has worked, she would probably be in a lower-level position now. We could talk about all those unfair things that male politicians don't talk about. I do not want to have a VP who doesn't have the empathy to understand basic things about other people's life situations.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ari6mvykp_c&lc=Ugwy_sFoHjNzMdoe-Nt4AaABAg,@Zsuzsi-eu3pd,CNN,ari6mvykp_c,Hear Buttigieg’s response to Vance’s criticism of childless Democrats,"Former presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg who was speaking to CNN in his personal capacity, responded to past comments from JD Vance about people who don’t have children working in the government in an interview with CNN’s Kaitlan Collins. #CNN #news

I have seen many in my life in this position and they are miserable and depressed. So take this as an advice for better. Nothing against people who dont want to and are happy without kids. Everyone relax and access their own situation plz. If JD was running as Joe Biden mate I am sure this wouldn't be in the news this much.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ari6mvykp_c&lc=UgzMIhqPt9v8ChEIO-R4AaABAg,@writehaseeb,CNN,ari6mvykp_c,Hear Buttigieg’s response to Vance’s criticism of childless Democrats,"Former presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg who was speaking to CNN in his personal capacity, responded to past comments from JD Vance about people who don’t have children working in the government in an interview with CNN’s Kaitlan Collins. #CNN #news

"I'm not even a democrat and i disagree with what Vance said. I never understood this need to tell others how to live their life. It's totally arrogant and counterproductive. The last thing we need is to force people who don't want children to be parents. And if some women prefer to take care of animals or become a """"cat lady"""", that's a noble thing too. When did taking care of animals become a terrible thing, or miserable existence, as he put it. If you love kids, fine, have as many as you want. That's your choice.

After a clip of Donald Trump’s running mate from 2021 resurfaced on social media in which he claims that United States is being run by “childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and choices that they made,” the “Friends” star took to her Instagram story to call him out. “I truly can’t believe this is coming from a potential VP of The United States,” the actress wrote on Wednesday, adding, “All I can say is: Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day. I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.” The “Morning Show” star does not have any children and got candid in a December cover story in 2022 with Allure that she tried to get pregnant for many years but struggled with fertility and IVF.

"JD says “if we want a healthy ruling class in this country “. This is the core of the GOP, they want to be the ruling class and that’s their idea of “making America great”. This phrase in this video should be repeated often, along with his description of childless women being miserable and wanting to make the rest of the world miserable too.

After a clip of Donald Trump’s running mate from 2021 resurfaced on social media in which he claims that United States is being run by “childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and choices that they made,” the “Friends” star took to her Instagram story to call him out. “I truly can’t believe this is coming from a potential VP of The United States,” the actress wrote on Wednesday, adding, “All I can say is: Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day. I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.” The “Morning Show” star does not have any children and got candid in a December cover story in 2022 with Allure that she tried to get pregnant for many years but struggled with fertility and IVF.

He is disgusting.Not Having a child doesn't make you a bad or stupid or unqualified person! Funny that Jesus ( His God ) was childless too! Was be also a cat who didn't know what he wants? I don't think he could dare to make that statement. In fact, women who have children, look older, they are physically weaker and therefore I can say they are miserable and attack his wife. Let alone that a politician mom, most likely can't spend enough time with her family so shame on her for being a mom and a politician. 
I thought this guy was reasonable but he's no good. Just a racist with a little brain. I have no respect for him after this statement and whoever has the same belief system.

Just like everyone JD can have his own opinion as well. There is no need to be flamed up ... and it is true there are many who keep chasing a career but at some point in life they realize they should have made a family but guess it is too late now. I have seen many in my life in this position and they are miserable and depressed. So take this as an advice for better. Nothing against people who dont want to and are happy without kids. Everyone relax and access their own situation plz.

Vance For ‘Childless’ Women Comment,"Jennifer Aniston is sharing her disbelief for Republican Vice-Presidential nominee J.D. Vance’s past comments about “childless” women. After a clip of Donald Trump’s running mate from 2021 resurfaced on social media in which he claims that United States is being run by “childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and choices that they made,” the “Friends” star took to her Instagram story to call him out. “I truly can’t believe this is coming from a potential VP of The United States,” the actress wrote on Wednesday, adding, “All I can say is: Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day. I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.” The “Morning Show” star does not have any children and got candid in a December cover story in 2022 with Allure that she tried to get pregnant for many years but struggled with fertility and IVF.

Just like everyone JD can have his own opinion as well. There is no need to be flamed up ... and it is true there are many who keep chasing a career but at some point in life they realize they should have made a family but guess it is too late now. I have seen many in my life in this position and they are miserable and depressed. So take this as an advice for better. Nothing against people who dont want to and are happy without kids. Everyone relax and access their own situation plz. If JD was running as Joe Biden mate I am sure this wouldn't be in the news this much.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSCByGqEOTw&lc=Ugy9KcMlk7UC_YBkiT94AaABAg,@writehaseeb,LBC,cSCByGqEOTw,JD Vance faces backlash after referring to Kamala Harris as a ‘childless cat lady’ | LBC reacts,"Shelagh Fogarty reacts as comments made by prospective Vice President JD Vance regarding Kamala Harris resurface.
